# Impact_of_COVID-19_Lockdown_on_Air_Quality_Virginia
An insightful project to compare changes in air quality index (AQI) levels for carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) before and during the COVID-19 Virginia lockdown to corroborate the impact of human activities on air pollution

Project Title
Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Outdoor Air Quality in Virginia

I. File list
------------
-Master_Dataset   Contains compiled final data for analysis

-SourceCode 		  Contains code as IPYNB files along with respective HTML formats

-Pollutants.zip		Contains raw data for all years individually

-README			      This file


II. Prerequisites
-----------------
- Microsoft Excel
- Anaconda Navigator
- Jupyter Lab (Python Kernel)


III.The Dataset
---------------
Data for required pollutants has to be downloaded from the EPA web servers (https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data) , 
into a readable CSV(Refer Pollutants.zip) which can then be compiled in Microsoft Excel to include all the years required for analysis
Prerequisites to form the final dataset (Refer Master_Dataset).


IV. Setting Up System Environment
---------------------------------
Launch a Jupyter Lab from the Anaconda Navigator with Python as kernel.
Upload csv files from Master_Dataset folder and IPYNB files from SourceCode folder into the file directory of Jupyter Lab.


IV. Running the Code
--------------------
Open the uploaded IPython file to be run in Jupyter, Go to Run->Run All Cells.

To Save results to HTML:
Go to File-> Export Notebook Asâ€¦->Export Notebook to HTML, and enter directory to save the file. 


V. Generating GeoMap from PaintMaps.com
---------------------------------------
Go to https://paintmaps.com/map-charts/274/Virginia-map-chart, 
Provide Data obtained from Impact table of the code results as input in format advised in the website with appropriate legend.
Click Update Data for generating the geomap.
Click 'Download Map (PNG)' to download the generated geomap as an image file.
